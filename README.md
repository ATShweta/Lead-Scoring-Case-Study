# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Objective

The primary objective is to create a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each potential lead in order to optimize the lead conversion process for X Education. This score will help the company identify 'Hot Leads,' which are more likely to convert into paying customers, thereby enabling the sales team to prioritize and focus their efforts on these leads.

To achieve this, the model will analyze various attributes of the leads, such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, and more. The goal is to improve the lead conversion rate from the current 30% to a target rate of around 80%, by ensuring that the sales team spends more time nurturing and converting the most promising leads.

Additionally, the model should be adaptable to future changes in the company's requirements. This includes handling categorical variables with levels like 'Select,' which represent null values, and addressing other specific challenges outlined in a separate document provided by the company. The final deliverables will include the logistic regression model, an analysis of its performance, and recommendations for its implementation in the company's lead management process.
